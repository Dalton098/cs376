- **What is the purpose of the operating system? What are its duties to the user? to the hardware?**
  - An operating system is special type of program that controls a computer’s hardware and also
    acts as a layer between the user and the hardware. The main purpose of the operating system is
    to facilitate the sharing of resources on a computer. One duty of the operating system is
    program execution which is running programs and determining which programs need to be
    running when. This serves the application. Another duty is I/O which is taking input from the
    user and giving output to the user. This serves the application. A third duty of the OS is user
    interface, this can come in the form of a GUI like windows or a command line interface such as
    MS-DOS. This serves the application. A fourth duty of the operating system is communications
    which involves sharing information between processes or even other computers. This serves the
    application.
- **Why is it hard to nail down the exact boundaries of the OS?**
  - As the OS is a piece of software itself, defining exactly what constitutes the OS is difficult.  We can confidently state: The operating system is software that facilitates the sharing of resources on a computer.
  - OS allows user to interact with applications, file systems, and devices. OS allocates shared hardware resources, file systems, and devices to the applications.
  - Vague in terms of what all this means and where it stops exactly
- **Components of von Neumann architecture - how they communicate, how the CPU sends requests and receives feedback from other components**
  - CPU does processing/executing of the instructions of a computer program and uses signals/commands to control other parts of the computer. CPU contains control unit and ALU
  - RAM is the memory unit and is directly accessible by the CPU
  - I/O interfaces allow the computer memory to receive info and send data to output devices. Allow the computer to communicate to the user
  - System bus is used to transfer messages between different parts of the computer (cpu, memory, etc)
- **How is a device (ie disk, memory, keyboard) able to fulfill requests  (ie how does the controller work. what's the difference between controller and driver)**
  - The device driver is software that operates a device whereas the controller is hardware that makes sense of signals going to and coming from the CPU. The device driver works as a translator between the hardware device and the operating system
- **Why might different hardware platforms need different versions of hardware divers? ie a Mac would need a different printer driver than a  Windows machine**
  - This is because the device driver acts as a middle man between the hardware device and the OS. It is like a translator between the two and different OSs speak different languages so you need different device drivers for each.
- **Why are interrupts used - especially in the case of I/O with a disk, screen, file, or keyboard?**
  - An interrupt is a signal to the CPU that indicates an event needs immediate attention and
    request that the CPU interrupt the currently executing program to attend to the request. The
    purpose of interrupts is that it allows for better control over the computer. Instead of having to
    wait for an application to finish running and hope that what they want done has the highest
    priority, the CPU will deal with the process immediately. The different types of interrupts are
    hardware interrupts and software interrupts. Hardware interrupts come from the hardware and
    signal that they need some attention. This can come in the form of typing on a keyboard for
    instance. Software interrupts are generated by programs when they want to make a system call
    to be performed. Interrupts are signals describing the location where the code that performs a
    given interrupt’s request is located.
- **As memory gets faster, it's smaller and more expensive. Know that hierarchy**
  - The storage devices closest to the CPU are registers and cache which are located inside the CPU.
    The next closest storage device would be main memory/RAM. These storages devices are all
    quick in comparison to the other types of memory. They have short access times, but these
    types of memory are much more costly than the other types of memory, so they are used in
    relatively small amounts. They are also volatile storage devices which means that they do not
    store data permanently. This is where hard disk and magnetic tape come in. They can hold data
    permanently and they are much cheaper so you can have much larger hard disk than ram.
- **Difference between cpu, core, and processor**
  - A processor is a generic name used to describe a CPU. A CPU is a central processing unit that is a
    component of a computer. A computer can have multiple processors. It carries out operations
    such as arithmetic, logical, control, and input and output. A core is a unit inside the CPU that
    receives and executes instructions. A CPU can have multiple cores.
- **What are the different levels of the programs?**
  - Kernel is the segment of the operating system that is running at all times
  - System programs are programs that are associated with the operating system, but are not always running (device driver, assembler, boot program)
  - Applications are programs that are not associated with the OS (Word, Excel)
- **What's the difference between a system call and the kernel?**
  - The kernel is the core of the operating system and is the first program that is loaded into main
    memory and remains there until the computer is turned off. The kernel acts as a translator that
    makes the computer understand commands from the user. The kernel differs from system
    programs because the kernel is always running but system programs are not.
- **How do higher level languages invoke system calls? Give an example.**
  - The operating systems provide some form of an API. For example Windows API or Java API for the JVM
  - API allows for portability because system calls may differ from OS to OS. System calls are more complicated than those in the API.
- **What's a process? Why is the PCB necessary?**
  - A process is a program during its execution along with the data that describes that execution including the program counter, the values of the registers, the process identifier, and other relevant info.
  - PCB contains the info associated with each process. Includes the process state, program counter, CPU registers, CPU scheduling info, memory management info, account info, I/O status info
- **Explain how a process creates a child process.** 
  - Using fork(). A child process is created as a copy of its parent parent process and copys/inherits most of its attributes.
- **What is the difference between fork and exec**
  - Fork() creates a process duplicate to the calling process except the child has its own ID, the child’s parent process ID = parent’s process ID, child does not inherit its parent’s access to memory locations, and the child does not inherit outstanding async I/O operations.
  - Exec() replaces the program running in that process with another program
- **Be able to give out put of a fork/exec piece of code**
- **Give one way a child process can communicate with its parent process?**
  - The return value of fork() gives the parent the child’s PID. Parent can get the exit status of the child
- **Why is the queue data structure important for OS process management?**
  - It is the way in which process management is handled. It is a FIFO manner. CPU uses a queue that contains the ID of processes that are ready to execute. The OS retrieves the process’s information and loads it into the CPU to be processed.
- **What are the different ways processes can communicate? Advantages and Disadvantages of each?**
  - For synchronous when sending, the sending process is blocked until the message reaches where it is intended to go. When sending with asynchronous communication, the process sends the message and then goes back to what it was doing. When blocking with synchronous, the receiver is blocked until a message is available whereas with asynchronous, the receiver retrieves a message or a null. Asynchronous is faster but it is less reliable than synchronous. Usually, both types of communication are available in the system.
